# AI-Driven Training Oversight System  
## Enhancing the Execution Phase of the PPBE Process with AI Integration  

###  Overview
This project enhances the **Execution Phase of the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process** by integrating AI-driven oversight mechanisms to improve training workflow visibility, accountability, and efficiency.

The system models training processes, approval hierarchies, and SME (Subject Matter Expert) assignments while leveraging structured reasoning to detect delays and recommend improvements.

---

###  Problem Statement
Training delays and limited oversight within the PPBE Execution phase reduce budget efficiency and mission readiness.

This project introduces structured AI-based monitoring to:
- Detect approval bottlenecks  
- Improve SME assignment efficiency  
- Enhance compliance and accountability  
- Support real-time decision-making

###  System Architecture

**Data Inputs**
- Training materials catalog  
- SME availability and scheduling  
- Approval timelines  
- Feedback and completion tracking  

**AI Interpretation**
- Delay detection (e.g., approvals overdue > 10 business days)  
- SME assignment optimization  
- Feedback-driven performance analysis  

**System Outputs**
- Real-time alerts  
- Reassignment suggestions  
- Improvement tracking  

---

###  Key Features
- Ontology modeling using **Protégé**
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for workflow structure
- Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time monitoring
- AI-driven use cases with structured reasoning logic
- Governance-focused decision support system

---

###  AI Use Cases

**1. Delayed Training Detection**  
Triggers alerts when approval timelines exceed defined thresholds.

**2. SME Assignment Optimization**  
Matches subject matter experts based on availability and expertise.

**3. Feedback-Driven Improvements**  
Analyzes training feedback to flag content for review and refinement.
